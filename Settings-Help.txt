This is the help file for the "Set" page with various settings:

* Periodic Wakeup will periodically turn your network (wifi/mobile data) on when the app has turned it off and the screen is off. 

This can help device apps and services periodically check in with the network while still saving battery/doze time most of the time. 

Also, this can help reduce network congestion when you do turn the device back on, because most apps and services have synced during this period. 

Note that time between wakeups is approximate. 

A sensible setting would be 30 minutes between wakeups, 3 minute wakeup period.
