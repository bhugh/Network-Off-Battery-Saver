# Network-Off-Battery-Saver
This android app turns off wifi and mobile data when the screen is off. They turn back on when the screen is on, and also whenever the phone is plugged in.   

This can save large amounts of battery.

Users have achieved 1% battery use per hour or less, during screen off periods.

The disadvantages are small, as you can still receive phone calls and sms messages while wifi & mobile data are off. 

Three other modes are selectable and occasionally useful:

 * Leave Network Alone - ie, temp disable most app functions 

 * Keep  Network Always Off - ie, airplane mode lite

 * Temporarily Keep Network On for a period - ie, if you're uploading or downloading a number of files and need your network to be up for a while, but not forever. 

Root required. Help file has many details and questions answered.

Version 2.2
